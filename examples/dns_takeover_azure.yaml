# This example configuration file can be used with the Rapid7 Open Data
# FDNS 'ANY' dataset to identify domains that point to Azure resources.
# The results can then be tested for possible subdomain takeover.
# The R7 Open Data FDNS data is gzipped JSON.
# Example command:
# pigz -dc 2021-01-29-1611879052-fdns_any.json.gz | secern --config dns_takeover_azure.yaml -n
#
# Reference:
#  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/subdomain-takeover

sinks:
  # This sink removes any records that aren't a CNAME
  - name: not_cname
    # Define outout as 'null' so matches are thrown away
    file_name: null
    # Invert the match logic. If the line doesn't match the patterns
    # then secern would normally process it with the following sinks
    # but in this case, with invert, we treat it as a match.
    # The result is that if a line DOESN'T contain the pattern then
    # secern will write it to the sink's output, in this case 'null',
    # and cease further processing of the line.
    #
    # This can be useful for filtering out data that is undesirable
    # and it can optimize performance by not processing lines that
    # couldn't or shouldn't be matched by later sinks.
